# Early Tests

**KeypadTest[1...n]** - Simple keypad based menu chooser prototype for 1602 shield. Custom LCD characters were generated using the online tool at http://omerk.github.io/lcdchargen/.

**LCDKeypad** - Keypad/LCD library that worked best with my 1602 LCD Keypad shield, which uses nonstandard pinouts.

**Make Magazine Motor Test** - Code from [Driving Big Stepper Motors with Arduino](http://makezine.com/video/driving-big-stepper-motors-with-arduino/) article with modifications.
